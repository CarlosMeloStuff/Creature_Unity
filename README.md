# Creature-Runtimes

This is the runtime for Creature, the advanced 2D Skeletal and Mesh Animation Tool. This runtime is for Unity 5.0 and up. It allows you to load in, play back and control your authored Creature Characters in the Unity environment. Mecanim support is also provided.

For more information on how to use the runtimes, please head over to this [site](http://www.kestrelmoon.com/creaturedocs/Game_Engine_Runtimes_And_Integration/Runtimes_Introduction.html)

## Deploying for iOS and other platforms
If you are having issues with deploying for platforms like iOS ( **UnusedBytecodeStripper2.exe did not run properly etc.** ), you should give the following a go:

1) Remove the **CreatureFlatData.dll** from the **Distro** directory

2) Create a new folder in your project and include the files:

[Creature FlatBuffers Source](https://github.com/kestrelm/Creature_Unity/tree/master/FlatBuffersCSharp)

3) Build and deploy your project

This should remove any sort of DLL dependency on your project.
